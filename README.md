# Where to put these
In the root of your sdcard, create a directory called `retrobit games` - your ROMs and
card images should all go in there

# Naming convention
The card images should match your ROM file names exactly but with the suffix `game`

Example:  
`1943 Kai.pce`  
`1942 Kaigame.png`  

The filename of the ROM is what shows up in the interface on the Super Retro-Cade as the
name of the game, e.g.:  
`1943 Kai`

# What's included?
348 covers, a mix of PC Engine and TurboGrafx 16 HuCards.

If there's only one regional version of a particular game included, the filename doesn't
reflect any region. For example, `1943 Kai` is a Japanese PC Engine game, but the filename
doesn't reflect that it's Japanese.

If there are two regional versions of a particular game included, the filename of the
Japanese release reflects the region, but the English-localised version does not.

Example:  
`Bomberman 93game.png` (TurboGrafx 16 release)  
`Bomberman 93 (J)game.png` (PC Engine release)
